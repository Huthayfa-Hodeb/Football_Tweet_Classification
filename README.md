# Football_Tweet_Classification
Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model usingXGBoost to classify football tweets as either fake or real. The ability todistinguish between genuine and misleading information in tweets canbe valuable in various applications, such as news verification and socialmedia analysis.


Dataset Description
For this project, we collected the data from Kaggle, a popular platformfor data science competitions and datasets. The dataset consists of twoseparate files, each containing unlabeled tweets related to football.One file contains tweets that are labeled as real, while the other fileconsists of tweets labeled as fake.


Feature Engineering
For this project, we collected the data from Kaggle, a popular platformfor data science competitions and datasets. The dataset consists of twoseparate files, each containing unlabeled tweets related to football.One file contains tweets that are labeled as real, while the other fileconsists of tweets labeled as fake.


Model Training
We employed a pipeline approach for model training, encompassingdata preprocessing, TF-IDF feature engineering, and training theXGBoost model. This streamlined process ensured consistency andefficiency in our classification task of football tweets into fake or realcategories.


Results
The XGBoost model achieved a high accuracy of 94% in classifyingfootball tweets as fake or real. Challenges such as sarcasm and subtlenuances may impact the model's performance. Future improvementscould explore advanced NLP techniques and incorporate larger anddiverse datasets. Enhancing the model's understanding and addressingdynamic fake news would further refine its effectiveness in social mediaanalysis.
